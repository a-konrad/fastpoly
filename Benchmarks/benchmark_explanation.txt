Explanation of the benchmarks created for our FMCAD'2025 submission with title:

"FastPoly: An Efficient Polynomial Package for Symbolic Computer Algebra"

by Alexander Konrad and Christoph Scholl, University of Freiburg
================================================================================

The benchmarks in this folder contain information for specifying a starting polynomial
and a series of polynomial substitution steps. For details on how the benchmarks there created
we refer to the paper written above.

The benchmarks have the following structure:

Line 1: Defines the maximum variable index used in the polynomial. This is necessary for 
	the initialization of the polynomial.
	
Line 2: Defines the modulo coefficient which is used to reduce all occuring monomial coefficients
	during substitution steps.
	If this line contains only a 0, modulo reduction of coefficients will be turned off.
	
Line 3: The description of the starting polynomial.

Lines 4+: From line 4 on, the polynomials for the substitution steps are written down.
		Each line for one substitution step.
